## What is RivaTuner Statistics Server?

**RivaTuner Statistics Server** (RTSS) is a legendary, professional-grade software suite designed for **hardware monitoring**, **on-screen display** (OSD) management, and **framerate control**. Developed by the renowned Unwinder, it is the backbone of the popular MSI Afterburner application and is considered an essential tool for PC gamers, overclockers, benchmarkers, and streamers.

With **RivaTuner Statistics Server**, users gain unparalleled insight into their system's performance, displaying critical real-time statistics directly in-game. This includes detailed metrics like **FPS (Frames Per Second)**, **frametime graphs**, **GPU and CPU usage**, temperatures, clock speeds, and much more. Its most powerful feature is the highly customizable and low-overhead **on-screen display**, which can be tailored to show exactly the information you need.

Beyond monitoring, **RivaTuner Statistics** provides industry-leading **framerate limiting** capabilities, known for its superior smoothness and consistency compared to in-game limiters. This helps eliminate screen tearing without the input lag penalty of V-Sync. The **RivaTuner Statistics Server** is compatible with virtually every DirectX and OpenGL application, making it a universal solution for performance tuning and analysis.
